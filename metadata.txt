about=The Field Profiler plugin provides an advanced analysis of attribute data for vector layers in QGIS.
 It calculates a comprehensive suite of statistics for numeric, text, and date fields, including distribution metrics,
 data quality indicators (like nulls, conversion errors, non-printable characters), and unique value summaries.
 Users can analyze all features or only selected features and can select features directly from the results table
 based on specific statistical criteria. This tool aids in data understanding, quality assessment, and cleaning.
